# Landing-page
A satirical, lore-driven landing page themed around Aether’s search for Lumine from Genshin Impact.
Originally built as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations course, this project was extended with a custom narrative, character-based reports, and a light in-universe investigation theme.

The focus is on clean HTML structure, Flexbox layout, maintaining visual hierarchy and Integrating thematic storytelling.
